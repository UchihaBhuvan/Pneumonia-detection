# Pneumonia-detection

This repository contains the code for a convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

Project Overview
This project aims to create a CNN model capable of classifying chest X-ray images as either healthy or with pneumonia. The model utilizes a deep learning approach to extract features from the images and predict the presence of pneumonia. You have to run the app.py for the website to launch which in turn uses the CNN model to detect the uploaded image of Chest x-ray is affected by pneumonia or not.

Installation
To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:
->Python 3.6 or higher
->TensorFlow
->Keras
->NumPy
->scikit-learn
->flask
->matplotlib
